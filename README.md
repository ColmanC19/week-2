## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop._
* _Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"_
* _If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser._


_{I believe you can run this on any system. I did download the most recent version of bootstrap and jquery}_



_{No known bugs at this point}_



_{If you run into any issues, or want any additional information please contact me at curriecolman@gmail.com.}_



_{I used html, css, javascript, bootstrap (* Bootstrap v3.3.7 (http://getbootstrap.com)) and jquery (jQuery JavaScript Library v3.4.1
* https://jquery.com/).}. _
